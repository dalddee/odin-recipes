            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <div id="ingredients"> 
                    <li>kimchi (the more fermented, the better)</li>
                    <li>minced garlic</li>
                    <li>onions</li>
                    <li>red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>red pepper paste (not necessary)</li>
                    <li>meat of your choice (pork belly is most commonly used)</li>
                    <li>peppers</li>
                    <li>green onions</li>
                    <li>water</li>
                    <li>tofu</li>
                    <li>salt/soy sauce if needed</li>
                </div>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <div id="step">
                    <li>Prepare the ingredients. Chop the kimchi, onions, peppers, tofu, and green onions into preferred sizes.</li>
                    <li>Cook the kimchi and meat (if using) on medium-high heat with a bit of cooking oil. Mixing in a bit of sesame oil is suggested if available. <em>(In this process, you can add the red pepper flakes, garlic, red pepper paste, and soy sauce, or you can add them later after adding water)</em></li>
                    <li>After the kimchi and meat have relatively cooked where the kimchi appears to have 'softened' a bit, add the water and bring it to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Once the stew has begun to boil, add more red pepper flakes/garlic/salt/soy sauce as necessary. Adding more red pepper paste is not recommended in this step.</li>
                    <li>You can cook the stew for as long as you want. The longer you cook it, the deeper the flavors. Add the tofu and green onions a few minutes (10-20) before serving (with a bowl of white rice! XD)</li>
