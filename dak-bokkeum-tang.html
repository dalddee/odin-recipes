            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>chicken</li>
                    <li>potatoes (any kind)</li>
                    <li>carrots</li>
                    <li>onions</li>
                    <li>red pepper paste</li>
                    <li>red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>minced garlic</li>
                    <li>soy sauce</li>
                    <li>sugar</li>
                    <li>green onions</li>
                    <li>(optional but recommended)whole milk</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the chicken up if not already done so.</li>
                    <li>Marinate/drown the chicken in a bowl of milk and let sit for 30 minutes. This is to help get rid of the chicken smell when eating chicken.</li>
                        <em><p>As I said, milk is optional. If you do not have milk but are concerned about the smell, an alternative method is to quickly and briefly cook the chicken in a pot of boiling water on high heat. You are <strong>not</strong> cooking the chicken thoroughly. This should not take more than a minute or two. Think of it as blanching.</p>
                        <p>The only reason why milk is recommended is cooking the chicken in the sauce raw adds more depth to the flavor.<p></em>
                    <li>Prepare the other ingredients by chopping up the potatoes, carrots, and onions into chunky pieces. Put them aside. Slice the peppers and green onions diagonally. Put them aside separate from the other vegetables.
                    <li>For the sauce, add the red pepper paste, red pepper flakes, garlic, sugar, soy sauce, and then mix into a paste. Put it aside.</li>
                    <li>If you let the chcken rest in milk, rinse the chicken in cold water a few times after the 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a wide pot of boiling water, add the vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and onions) as well as the chicken. Pour the sauce over and close the lid. Leave to cook.</li>
                    <li>Once the pot has begun to boil and the potatoes are halfway cooked, add the peppers and green onions and leave to cook until the potatoes are finished cooking.</li>
                        <em><p>Depending on how much soup/liquid there is, you can either close the lid or keep the lid off. This is completely up to you and your preference. Personally, I like to let mine thicken up a bit more. Some people like having the soup there. Either way is delicious so feel free to experiment.</p></em>
                    <li>If the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are just about cooked, you are all ready to serve! Bon appetit! </li>
