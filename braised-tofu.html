        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>tofu</li>
                <li>red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>soy sauce</li>
                <li>sesame oil</li>
                <li>minced garlic</li>
                <li>green onions<li>
                <li>oyster sauce</li>
                <li>corn syrup/sugar (either or)<li>
                <li>peppers</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the square of tofu into evenly cut slices. This can be up to you and how you like your tofu, but try not to make it too thin or too thick.</li>
                <li>(**This step is optional**) Spread out and lay the slices of tofu down on a layer of paper towels or some sort of clean cooking cloth. Sprinkle some salt on top and add another layer of paper towels. Make as many layers as needed. Gently pat down and let the tofu sit for a few minutes while preparing the sauce.</li>
                    <em><p>This is to dry out the tofu a little bit so it better absorbs the sauce when cooking. Tofu naturally has a lot of moisture in it that will release when braising.</p></em>
                <li>While the tofu sits, dice the green onions and peppers in to small pieces.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, add the peppers, green onions, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and corn syrup/sugar. Mix until a relatively thick sauce is made (The sauce shouldn't be runny nor thick like a paste. Just enough to slowly fall of the spoon).</li>
                <li>(**This is optional**) After the tofu has dried a bit, drizzle a bit of cooking oil onto a heated pan. Add the tofu and fry on medium heat just until they're slightly a golden brown on each side.</li>
                    <em><p>Similar to the previous optional step, this is another optional one that serves the same purpose. it seals the moisture in and helps maintain the firmness and shape of the tofu.</p></em>
                <li>Once the tofu has cooked, pour water until the tofu is just covered. Add the sauce evenly onto the tofu and cook until the water is gone.<li>
                <li>Serve with a bowl of white rice and voila! A delicious Korean meal has been served.<li>
             </ol>
